For this mini-project, you’ll use the same hospital dataset you used for the frequentist inference mini-project (don’t worry — we’ve included it in the project file listed below.) You’ll analyze medical charge data to answer business questions and see firsthand how the bootstrap method can repeat the same tests you did in the frequentist mini-project (and yield consistent answers), but you’ll also use the approach to answer a question you couldn’t answer with frequentist inference.
